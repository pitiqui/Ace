        Welcome to Ace!

    <div class="welcome-content">
        Welcome to Ace! Ace is an extension framework for the new League client that allows developers to create various tweaks and plugins that either change or improve the workings of the client.
        <br>
        <b>Ace is currently in beta.</b> While we try to make sure that every tweak works as expected, you may run into issues. We have implemented a system that tries to minimize unexpected situations, especially when the client updates.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ace will automatically check for updates whenever you launch the League client via the Ace launcher. If an update is found, it is downloaded in the background and you'll be prompted to restart the client once it is ready. Upon starting the updated client, a small changelog screen will await you with an overview of all changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ace has various tweaks installed, most notably:
        <ul>
            <li>champion-groups, for creating custom champion groups for use in champ select.</li>
            <li>resize, for resizing the client (see that caret in the bottom right?).</li>
            <li>owned-skins, which adds a new 'Skins' tab in your collections.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The <b>settings</b> plugin provides various statistics and options, similar to the built-in settings panel. You can access the Ace settings by clicking on the Ace icon in the top right corner. You can also disable or enable plugins here.
